# 2021 Italian Grand Prix: RIC vs VER in stint 1

This code was shamelessly stolen from [this](https://medium.com/@jaspervhat/how-i-analyze-formula-1-data-with-python-2021-italian-gp-dfb11db4b73) blog.

This is mostly just a test by me to make sure that I have plenty of examples for future F1 telemetry projects that I hope to do with the `fastf1` python package.
